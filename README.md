# Brazillian E-commerce Olist: Guidance for new seller
## This project is the final project from Data Science Bootcamp at Coder School, VN
-- Project Status: Completed
###### Dataset
- I get this dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
- Describe about this Dataset: - This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers.
- This is real commercial data
### Project Intro/Objective
- The purpose of this project is to provide necessary and important information for new sellers who wish to enter this new online platform in Brazil
- Clarify 3 main questions for new sellers:
- What to sell ?
- Where are the potential customers ?
- When to sell ?
-Provide solutions based on these 3 criteria
###Methods Used
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
### Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- LDA model
- Bag of Word
- Google trans

### Project Description
- The data of this project came from kaggle (Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist). Our team firstly formed a big question about what the products are that are becoming popular as well as those that received lower demand from customers. We then redirected our big questions into helping new sellers who try to join this online platform and used the original big question as a key point to help answer the new question. We firstly tried to apply data cleaning and then do some visualizations on finding top trending products. Then we drew charts and defined specific time zones in which customers paid the most and lastly we analyzed comments left by customers in order to find out what the problems are that customers are usually complaining about.
- Throughout the entire project, we used various techniques in visualizing as well as cleaning / selecting relevant columns from the dataset such as seaborn countplot, pivot table, convert long form to wide form, etc. Furthermore, we also used scikit learn to apply machine learning for analyzing comments, grouping comments into top 10 topics and defining the top mentioned terms. For example: I received the product, I did not receive the product yet, etc.
- The big problem we were facing was to define the big question and find key ideas to support it. Not only did the big question need to be attractive and realistic, but also the key ideas to support it had to be in depth and clear.

### Needs of this project
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- writeup/reporting
- presentation skills
